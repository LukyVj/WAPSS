# WAPSS
The contraction of Weapon & CSS

## What is it ?

Basically, wapss is an idea that I think about since few month/years.
Its about creating a CSS First environement, that include a MVC like system in css, and a CMS like system in CSS.

And today, I think my idea and tools evolved enough, for starting to create my github project.

Actually, the WAPSS project use two main medium to work.

* [OVCSS](https://github.com/LukyVj/OVCSS) = Organise Views CSS
* [CSSMS](https://github.com/LukyVj/CSSMS) = A CSS CMS

These are basic tools that works ! I'm not saying that they are useful for everyone, but it was my challenge, and I try to make it happen.

With the time, I will make this project evolve, as well as the documentation.
